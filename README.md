### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github page. 

I'm a data scientist and physicist who loves programming for fun!

#### Languages I've Coded In
- Python for data science: Leveraging libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn to analyze and interpret complex datasets.
- C++ for numerical simulations: Building efficient, high-performance simulations for problems in biophysics.

#### I'm learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org)!
- [Vampire Survivors Clone](https://github.com/edoardodraetta/ninja_survivors)

#### ðŸŒ± What I'm Exploring Now
Deepening my understanding of machine learning algorithms and their applications in real-world scenarios.
Experimenting with game development to create engaging, educational tools for physics students.

#### âš¡ Fun Fact
Every 2 months I develop a new hobby! Ask me what I'm on about lately...!
